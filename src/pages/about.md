This _whole site_ is about me. Why should I summarize it on one page?
Let's talk about the site, instead.

This site is generated using the [Pelican](https://getpelican.com) static site generator using Markdown source files and [Jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) templates. The content is served from Github Pages.

[Site theme](#) was originally adapted from [monospace](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/monospace), but later restyled using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

The content is organized to showcase my work, by aggregating content from other sources I contribute to. I also post occasional [weblog](https://andrewboring.com/content/weblog.html) content directly here.
