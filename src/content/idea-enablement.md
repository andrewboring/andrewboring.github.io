Ideas are nothing without execution.

1. The problem:
people have ideas they think are good, but don't know how to build it
people think their ideas are worthwhile, but don't know how to prove it


2. The analog
Service-oriented economy.
Wealth management is a growing field of work.
People outsource personal tasks (taskrabbit, doordash, uber, etc).

3. The solution: idea Enablement
Help those prototype their ideas.
Does cost money. Can't do that silly "you can have a percentage of success".

No different from a "contract hire", but the focus is on specific deliverables including a working prototype or MVP, a one-page business model canvas, a product presentation or demo, and other new product solutions. The goal isn't to do this completely for the customer, but to help enable them to test the idea and follow-through.
